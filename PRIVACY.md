ClearURLs protects and respects your privacy. 
We do not collect any of your usage data. Furthermore ClearURLs has no home server nor embed any kind of analytic hooks in its code.

The only time ClearURLs connects to a remote server (gitlab.io) is to update the rules file and the associated hash file. You can replace the default update address with your own address at any time in the settings.

The project and the rule file is currently hosted on gitlab.com, which is owned by GitLab Inc. and thus is unrelated to ClearURLs.
