# ClearURLs

**ClearURLs** is an add-on based on the new WebExtensions technology and is optimized for *Firefox*.

This add-on will remove the tracking fields form all URLs which are visited by the browser and use a rule file, namely `data.json`.

This add-on protects your privacy and block the request from advertising services like *doubleclick.net*.

## Application
Large (and small) webpages use elements in the URL, e.g.: https://example.com?source=thisIstheSiteIvisitedBefore to track your online activities. In this example, the source field tells the provider which page you visited before. The add-on will remove these tracking fields from the URL.

## Installation
Install on [Firefox AMO.](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/clearurls/)
